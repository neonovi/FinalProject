Introduction to computer science final project

For our final project we made a car racing game with a challenging route. The obstacles are other random cars which move against the user 
car and the user should avoid clashing with them or he loses the game. There will a timer of 2 minutes in which the user has to finish the 
race without clashing with obstacles, if he does so, he wins.
