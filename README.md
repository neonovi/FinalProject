Our final project with mrymkhalili (Maryam Khalili)

For our final project we made a car racing game with some challenging routes. There are two levels. One is easy and he second one is hard.
After entering your name, the user gets to choose the route. The car is controlled by the arrow keys (WASD). 
Each route has its specific obstacles (rocks, trees and other things that can stop you from moving), if he
crushes into an obstacle he will have to start over. There is a time counter for the game;
when the user exits the game, his/her lowest time-count will be saved.
